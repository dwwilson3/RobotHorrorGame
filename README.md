Introduction
------------
Does sound play a role in how a player navigates a video game? Does this differ for background sounds or sounds from game objects?
We want to be able to test whether or not gameplay and decision making is affected by sounds within the game. As the Unity Experiements group,
it is our job to develop 3D models/games/visuals to test human computer interaction. For our semseter project, we decided to look into video
game play and the effect of video game sound. 



Solution
--------
We used Unity and various audio (prosody, text to speech, background music) to create a video game that can be used to test 
the effect of sound and gestures on decision making in a stressful situation.
